# Helsinki Places

This is a simple assignment web application that shows places in Helsinki.

## Helsinki Maps

1. Create a React application to display a map. Then using this [Helsinki API](https://open-api.myhelsinki.fi/doc) to get a data about places of interest in Helsinki, and show them on the map as markers. Keep in mind that the data return by the API is huge, so make sure to use pagination.

2. User can add reviews to these places on your map, for example: comments, ratings, etc.

Tech stacks recommendation:
- React
- Redux
- `react-mapbox-gl` or `google-map-react`
  for displaying map
